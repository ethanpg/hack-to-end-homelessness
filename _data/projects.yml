  description: Building Changes is introducing an innovative approach to prevent family homelessness through a strategy called Diversion. Diversion means keeping families from ever entering the homeless service system. Families get exactly the kind of flexible, short-term they need so housing resources are freed up for those who need it most. Hack 2 End participants worked together to create a beautiful and informative infographic to be used as a tool for communicating the benefit of Diversion to Funders and Service Providers in King County and around Washington State.

  description: Four different groups came to the Hackathon with similar needs - they have multiple data sources that they know could tell a story, and they need to be able to tell legislators, community members and the media that story. Team Maptastics gathered a brilliant collection of data and development professionals to churn through the many data sources to create a map that tells the story of who&mdash;in their county, legislative district, or school district&mdash;is experiencing challenges with affordable housing.

  description: The Committee to End Homelessness wanted to utilize data from other metro areas to better understand our context – especially the need in our community (number of people homeless) and our response (number and type of housing units/beds). Yet with hundreds of data points and hundreds of jurisdictions nationally, analysis and simplification of the results was needed. We analyzed data from 25 major metro areas and developed a web-based map and charts. The map allows a user to review data over 7 years and across multiple data points (number homeless, number of shelter beds, etc) and compare cities, apples to apples, by using per capita data.

  description: Tonight we will have too many kids without a safe place to rest their head, do their homework, eat a hot meal, or call home.  Homelessness is a crisis for these families and is unacceptable in a community like ours. Our shelters are full, poverty is growing, and affordable housing is scarce. While we can’t solve all of these problems tonight – we believe we can and must take action to make sure no child sleeps on the streets of King County. That’s why Church Council of Greater Seattle, Seattle University School of Theology and Ministry and United Way of King County have come together to support the No Child Sleeps Outside in King County initiative.

  description: "YouthCare's James W. Ray Orion Center offers a wealth of services to Seattle's homeless young people, including low-barrier services like meals and drop-in hours, during which young people ages 13-22 can access basic needs and connect with our staff to talk about goals and connecting to deeper services like case management, shelter, housing, education, and employment training. We collect basic information about who is coming into the building for services, which services they are accessing, and how often the access the services. But we aren't able to analyze the data in the format it's collected in. This project had two goals: to develop macros allowing us to analyze the current spreadsheet data, and to develop a new way to collect data that made future analysis easier."
