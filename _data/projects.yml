  description: Building Changes wanted help telling the story of their work in a more compelling way for new donors and others who are unfamiliar with their work. TLA spent the weekend designing a clearer explanation of what diversion is in the context of homelessness and a new infographic, and redesigning one of the organizationâ€™s existing fundraising brochures.
